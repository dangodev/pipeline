| :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| [Homebrew]  | The unofficial package manager for Mac.                                            |

## üöÄ Install

Run the folowing command in a terminal ([view source][source])

```
sh -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drwpow/pipeline/main/bin/pipeline)"
```

## üíÖ Customizing

The following steps can‚Äòt be set from the shell command. But they‚Äôre also
based on your personal preference anyway, so here‚Äôs where you get to customize!

- [ ] Change the font in your terminal to the newly-installed ‚ÄúPerplexed‚Äù font in order for the icons to work correctly. Many terminals don‚Äôt allow changing this via the shell, so this is a manual change.
- [ ] Grab an ‚ú® awesome terminal background from [here][awesome-terminal-backgrounds].
- [ ] In your terminal, change your ANSI colors to match your new theme better

## ü§ì Commands

Okay, it‚Äôs installed‚Ä¶ now what can I do?

| Command                         | What it does                                                                                                                     |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| (start typing)                  | Your shell will now highlight correct commands in **green**, incorrect ones in **red**‚Äîbefore you hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>!          |
| (start typing) + <kbd>tab</kbd> | Start typing any command, and hit <kbd>tab</kbd>. Your shell will try and complete it for you!                                   |
| `z [my-folder]`                 | Jump quickly from any folder to another, by typing its name (_note: `cd` into it first_)                                         |
| `gl`                            | `git pull --rebase` Update branch with origin                                                                                    |
| `gpf`                           | `git push --force --force-with-lease` Force-push but fail if something changed remotely (great for ninja edits without the risk) |
| `grc`                           | `git rebase --continue` If rebasing through a conflict, continue                                                                 |
| `grm`                           | `git rebase -i origin/master` Rebase current branch from master                                                                  |

### Tips

- **Manage Node with ease.** Add a `.nvm` file in any folder with `16.13.0` (or any node version). Now whenever you‚Äôre in that folder, [fnm] will automatically switch the Node version for you üéâ (if you‚Äôre missing that version, just run `fnm install [version]`).
- **Ditch editor projects.** If you use VS Code, install the `code` command (<kbd>‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>, type `code`). Now you can jump between projects with `z project1 && code .` and `z project2 && code .`

## üíÅ FAQ

### Why fnm for Node?

fnm (‚ÄúFast Node Manager‚Äù) is lightweight, simple, no-fuss, and easy to use. You can also install new versions as soon as they‚Äôre released (something nodenv struggled with). Though some prefer Volta, I personally find it confusing, so to each their own.

### I don‚Äôt have a cool gradient background! How do I get one?

Alas, terminal backgrounds (along with fonts) are something this script cannot do. But good news! You can find many great backgrounds at [‚ú® awesome-terminal-backgrounds][awesome-terminal-backgrounds].

### How can I change the terminal segments / what if I want something else instead of Node version?

[Bullet Train][bullet-train], was built for customization (and why I prefer it over the similar-looking Agnoster theme for zsh). In your `.zshrc` file, you‚Äôll see the following lines:

```
prompt_emoji() {
  prompt_segment black white "‚ú®"
}
BULLETTRAIN_PROMPT_ORDER=(emoji status dir nvm git)
BULLETTRAIN_PROMPT_ADD_NEWLINE=false
BULLETTRAIN_PROMPT_CHAR=""
BULLETTRAIN_DIR_BG=magenta
BULLETTRAIN_DIR_FG=black
BULLETTRAIN_GIT_BG=green
BULLETTRAIN_GIT_COLORIZE_DIRTY=true
BULLETTRAIN_GIT_EXTENDED=false
BULLETTRAIN_GIT_FG=black
BULLETTRAIN_NVM_BG=black
BULLETTRAIN_NVM_FG=green
BULLETTRAIN_NVM_SHOW=true
```

Edit `BULLETTRAIN_PROMPT_ORDER` to change the terminal prompt. You can swap any out for for Ruby, Kubernetes, Go, and more! You can also adjust the foreground & background colors for each segment. [Read more][bullet-train]

### What other themes are there?

Oh My Zsh has [quite a few built-in themes][oh-my-zsh-theme], as well as a wide selection of [third-party ones][oh-my-zsh-external]. Give ‚Äôem all a spin!

### I‚Äôm seeing weird symbols in my terminal. Is that normal?

You probably need to change your font to ‚ÄúPerplexed,‚Äù a patched version of IBM Sans with built-in icons for your terminal.

### I don‚Äôt like the terminal font. Can I change it?

You can install any font with **modified special characters\*** (needed for the icons in terminal). You can find such fonts here:

- [Nerd Fonts]
- [Powerline Fonts]

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstalling

There‚Äôs not an uninstall script, but the changes this script makes are easy
to undo:

| Change                           | Uninstalling                                                                                                |
| :------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Xcode tools                      | [Uninstall docs][xcode-uninstall] (but this is Apple software and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend removing it).        |
| fnm, Git                         | `brew uninstall fnm git`                                                                                    |
| Homebrew                         | [Uninstall][homebrew-uninstall]                                                                             |
| Oh My Zsh                        | [Uninstall][oh-my-zsh-uninstall] (note that this will also remove plugins & theme changes as well)          |
| `~/.hushlogin`                   | This hides the annoying ‚ÄùLast login‚Äù message on every terminal bootup. Delete this empty file to undo it.   |
| `~/Library/Perplexed-Normal.otf` | 1 font was installed for your convenience. Uninstall ‚ÄúPerplexed Normal‚Äù via Font Book, or delete this file. |
| `~/.zshrc.pre-oh-my-zsh`         | Oh My Zsh will leave this around, in case you want to switch back to your preexisting setup.                |

That‚Äôs it! No other files or system settings were affected.

## Ô∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About

This setup script came about from several people over the years asking me [about my config][config], and to set up their machines. I had more than 2 people ask, so I automated it ü§ñ.

I also don‚Äôt like a ton of tools. So this doesn‚Äôt add any cruft; only the tried-and-true tools I‚Äôve used for years.

This software is **public domain**. Remix, copy, steal, whatever‚Äîjust use it to help others! Use at your own risk.
