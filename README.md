![pipeline](./pipeline.png)

Rad setup scripts to get your Mac [_pitted_](https://youtu.be/Y5ckCAUVOn0?si=puIdT-Yu3xuY1mZK) for development. Installs the bare-minimum most dev setups need:

| [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)                                    | The unofficial package manager for Mac.                                            |
| [Git](https://git-scm.com/)                                     | Standard version control for modern software.                                      |

## üöÄ Quickstart

> ‚ö° **Tip**
>
> [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) or [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) is **strongly recommended** for Terminal. It has better color support and more modern features than the default Terminal application.

Run the folowing command in a terminal ([view source](https://github.com/drwpow/pipeline/blob/main/bin/pipeline)):

```sh
sudo sh -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drwpow/pipeline/main/bin/pipeline)"
```

_Note: This script is safe to re-run as many times as you‚Äôd like. `sudo` is only required for installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and can be skipped if you‚Äôve installed that already._

### ‚Ü™Ô∏è Next Steps

- [Configure iTerm manually](https://iterm2.com/documentation-preferences.html) also according to your liking
- Dive into [powerlevel10k‚Äôs advanced config](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration) for finetuning your theme.
- If you need [Git LFS](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs) you‚Äôll need to install it manually.

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstalling

There‚Äôs not an uninstall script, but the changes this script makes are fully reversible:

| Change                   | Uninstalling                                                                                                                                            |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| fnm, Git                 | `brew uninstall fnm git`                                                                                                                                |
| Homebrew                 | [Uninstall](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#how-do-i-uninstall-homebrew)                                                                                       |
| Oh My Zsh                | [Uninstall](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-uninstall-oh-my-zsh) (note that this will also remove plugins & theme changes as well) |
| `~/.hushlogin`           | This hides the annoying ‚ÄùLast login‚Äù message on every terminal bootup. Delete this empty file to undo it.                                               |
| `~/.zshrc.pre-oh-my-zsh` | Oh My Zsh will leave this around, in case you want to switch back to your preexisting setup.                                                            |

## Ô∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About

I‚Äôve had to set up a lot of dev machines over the years, and this saves me time. This is something I always run on all my new machines. You can also take a peek at [my configfiles](https://github.com/drwpow/config), too.
